## Log

### Day 1: Nov 26, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Started Week 1 Intro to Cpp by CS106B. 

**Thoughts:** Post-exam Day 0: Researched about learning Cpp/C and decided on learning Cpp! 
My Goal: To learn more about and apply  fundamentals behind memory allocation and so on.

### Day 2: Nov 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learnt Git By Concept. 

**Thoughts:** I often just searched Git commands to use without really understanding fully what might each command do. Next up would install a Git visualiser like Git Kraken.

### Day 3: Nov 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up CS106B Lect 2 and 3 (Week 1). Installed Qt IDE and setup sample project. Completed Coding Assignment 1. 

**Thoughts:** Cpp seems like a really interesting language - the first week's handout list down a couple of key features of Cpp (in comparison to Java). I can understand better why some say learning Cpp/C will allow you to have a better grasp of what's going on below the hood (e.g. lack of automatic garbage collector for Cpp, means you have to determine when to release memory references).

The annoying thing about CS106B is that it took quite a while to find free access to Qt and to accessing the Stanford standard library which means I have to implement functions like getInteger getRandom etc from scratch for the assignments. Found that the links below helped.
