## Log

### Day 1: Nov 26, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Started Week 1 Intro to Cpp by CS106B. 

**Thoughts:** Post-exam Day 0: Researched about learning Cpp/C and decided on learning Cpp! 
My Goal: To learn more about and apply  fundamentals behind memory allocation and so on.

### Day 2: Nov 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learnt Git By Concept. 

**Thoughts:** I often just searched Git commands to use without really understanding fully what might each command do. Next up would install a Git visualiser like Git Kraken.

### Day 3: Nov 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up CS106B Lect 2 and 3 (Week 1). Installed Qt IDE and setup sample project. Completed Coding Assignment 1. 

**Thoughts:** Cpp seems like a really interesting language - the first week's handout list down a couple of key features of Cpp (in comparison to Java). I can understand better why some say learning Cpp/C will allow you to have a better grasp of what's going on below the hood (e.g. lack of automatic garbage collector for Cpp, means you have to determine when to release memory references).

The annoying thing about CS106B is that it took quite a while to find free access to Qt and to accessing the Stanford standard library which means I have to implement functions like getInteger getRandom etc from scratch for the assignments. Found that the links below helped.

### Day 4: Nov 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: To learn more about GCP and its services, I coded a simple Slack Slash Command Bot to query Google Search. 

**Thoughts:** Still not sure what's the difference between GCP and AWS. Researched a little more, it seems like the biggest reason why AWS is the clear market leader now is due to it being the first to invest in cloud computing?

### Day 5: Nov 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Typescript React Conversion Guide where I've migrated a JS TicTacToe game into TS compiled with Webpack 4.

**Thoughts:** While this is not the first time I'm working with Typescript, it is the first time I have migrated from pure JS to pure Typescript and it does take a fair bit of time. I feel that this is worth it in the long time though as during the conversion, I actually found a small bug existing inside thr original Microsoft version which is amazing.

### Day 6: Dec 1, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Configured UPlan to use Webpack 4 on the client. Read up on Chpt 2 of CS106B Reader.

**Thoughts:** Not the first time working with Webpack, but was refreshing to start from scratch and got to explore the newer features of Webpack 4 (as compared to v2x) such as merge. Was a really satisfying feeling when it successfully deployed!
